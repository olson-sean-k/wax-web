Both the [code][repository-code] and [documentation][repository-doc]
repositories for Wax are hosted on GitHub.

Wax is developed, built, and tested using the latest stable release of Rust. It
is also tested on the MSRV, stable, beta, and nightly [release
channels][channels] using GitHub Actions. Code is formatted using the nightly
build of `rustfmt`.

Please see the contribution documentation in each repository for more details.
